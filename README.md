Team Name Pending
===========

An exciting project brought to you by Team 2 of the Fall 2013 Software Design and Evolution class at Villanova University.  Our official project is still pending, so check back soon!

Visual Studio
-------------
As this is a .NET project, Visual Studio is recommended as an IDE.  Visual Studio Express 2012 can be downloaded [here](http://www.microsoft.com/visualstudio/eng/downloads#d-2012-express)

Iteration Cycle
------------------
The group backlog can be found on our [Trello board](https://trello.com/b/gseqjsFB/sde-team-2, "Team Trello").  If you need access to this board, please let us know.

There are several columns: Backlog, Iteration, On Deck, In Progress, Ready for Review, and Complete.  The iteration cycle is split into 5 phases:

### Step One: Grooming
Cards are added to the Backlog list representing user stories.  These user stories are prioritized with the most critical at the top.  Stories can then be groomed by the team - each team member provides a number on a pseudo-Fibonacci scale: 1, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, etc.  A point value of one represents a trivial task, whereas higher numbers represent more complex tasks.

### Step Two: Planning
At the start of each iteration, we will have a planning session - we'll determine our velocity - how much work we think we can get done in that iteration, and pull user stories into our iteration from the backlog (we literally move the cards over from one column to the next).

### Step Three: Work
During the iteration, each of us will take on ONE story at a time - no more, no less.  Think of it this way: each of us has a "slot" in the On Deck and In Progress columns.  Only one thing can fill that slot at a time.  Once the story is complete, it moves on to the next column (Ready for Review), where another team member will review your code and validate that it meets the criteria of the story.  This process is roughly based on [Kanban](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kanban_(development\), "Kanban Wikipedia page") methods. On Deck indicates what you are planning on working on next so other team members don't inadvertently start working on it.  In Progress indicates what you are working on now.

### Step Four: Code Review
Our code review process should be simple: check out the code that the team member has flagged as ready for review, look over the code to ensure that it makes sense and run the unit tests.  If everything passes this quality check, move the card into the Complete column and it's done!  If something isn't working, add a comment to the card describing what problem you encountered and let the team member know that something needs to be fixed.
